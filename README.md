# MTMR-TradingBar

> William Kwok

MTMR-TradingBar is a locally hosted server aimed to provide special functionality to the [MTMR touchbar application](https://github.com/Toxblh/MTMR) to view live stock tickers, news, and user friendly config changing.

This is currently a work in progress, and will only be used by me and a few friends. User friendly installation is currently not on the roadmap for this project.
